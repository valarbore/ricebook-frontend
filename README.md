    This site doesn't work.

    This web application is fully functional with beautiful and user-friendly interface.
    I'd like to give it 10 out of 10.

    https://rice-react-app.surge.sh
    The error message on registration is vague.
    Missing a lot of features like logout, post new article, comments etc.
    I'd like to give it 5 out of 10.
