This project is based on React Boilerplate.(details in BoilerplateREADME)

Registered users are the users in the <a href='https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users'>JSON Placeholder users </a> with username as username and street as password.

The main logic functions are in reducer and saga, so the tests maily cover these files.
